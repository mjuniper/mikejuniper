I've previously posted a bunch on dojo, which is a very fine javascript library. But in the last year or so I've been using jQuery a bunch and I've got to say it is great. The dom selection and manipulation is more full featured and easier to use than dojo's. One thing that dojo has going for it is the classes and inheritance (dojo.declare, dojo.provide, dojo.require) but on a lot of projects, you just don't need that. It's interesting that both libraries recently released version 1.4 and at that version they both seem to have adopted some features of the other which I think is great. 

Expect to see some posts on jQuery from me in the future. If you haven't tried <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> yet, you should.
