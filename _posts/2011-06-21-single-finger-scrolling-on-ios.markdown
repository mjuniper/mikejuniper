title: Single finger scrolling in Mobile Safari

We built the <a href="http://uc.dtsagile.com">BackChannel</a> using the Mobile View Engine I discussed in <a href="http://www.mikejuniper.com/2011/03/mobile-device-detection-and-android/">this</a> post. If you hit the site with a phone we serve a mobile version, but if you hit it with a tablet, we serve the full version, which, of course, we expect to work. For the <a href="http://uc.dtsagile.com/agenda">schedule</a> page, I built a nifty full screen multi-pane interface that works perfectly in all desktop browsers I tried and in the Android 3.1 browser on my Xoom. But yesterday <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.com/">Dave</a> pointed out that the bottom left and right panes wouldn't scroll on iPad.

After a little digging, I found that Mobile Safari doesn't support single finger scrolling on divs. You have to use two fingers. This is actually documented in the <a href="http://support.apple.com/manuals/ipad/">iPad User Guide</a>. Presumably this is because on touch based devices it's hard to know if you intend to scroll the whole page or just the div. But, like I said, it works perfectly on my Xoom. Now, if I didn't know this, I certainly can't expect my users to.

I found that <a href="http://www.flexmls.com/developers/2011/04/13/ipad-and-single-finger-scrolling-in-flexmls/">Nick Larson</a> had created a very simple fix to implement single finger scrolling. I took it and rolled it into a jQuery plugin (my first, actually) using <a href="http://www.malsup.com/jquery/">Mike Alsup's</a> <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern">plugin pattern</a>. There are other solutions out there but mine has the virtue of being very easy to understand and very light (644 bytes minified).
